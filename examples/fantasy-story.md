## Synopsis

In a world where memories can be stolen and traded like currency, one young librarian discovers she's the last person who can preserve the truth.

## Chapter 1: The Forgotten Library

The dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight that pierced through the library's cracked dome. Aria ran her fingers along the spines of ancient books, each one a repository of memories long forgotten by the world.

"You shouldn't be here," came a voice from the shadows.

Aria didn't flinch. She'd been expecting this. "Neither should you, Keeper."

An old man emerged, his eyes clouded with the weight of a thousand stolen memories. He was a Memory Thief, one of the Order that had ruled the kingdom for three centuries.

"The books," he said softly, "they sing to you, don't they?"

She nodded. It was pointless to lie. He would know. They always did.

"You're the one," he continued, moving closer. "The one the prophecy spoke of. The Last Memory Keeper."

Aria's heart hammered in her chest. The prophecy was supposed to be a myth, a story told to frighten children and give hope to the desperate.

"There is no prophecy," she said, but her voice betrayed her doubt.

"There is," the old man replied, and for the first time, Aria saw something in his eyes that wasn't calculation or hunger—it was fear. "And if the Order finds out what you can do, they will drain every memory from your mind until there's nothing left but an empty shell."

He pressed something cold into her palm. A key.

"The Archive of Truth," he whispered. "It's real. And you're the only one who can reach it."

Before Aria could respond, the sound of shattering glass echoed through the library. The Order had arrived.
